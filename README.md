# Video Segmentation
Could a computer model differentiate between television commercials and shows?  This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn features which correspond to the two types of content. The following work forms the foundation of a system which could automatically filter commercials.

## Data
80 clips of television shows and 200 commercials were scrapped from Youtube.  A total of 60,000 images were extracted from the videos and used to train the neural network.  Below are some example images of frames taken from the videos.  

Could you pick out which are commercials and which are television shows?
